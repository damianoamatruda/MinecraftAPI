Getting Started
---------------
To use it, you need to include it:

    require_once('minecraft.php');

Then include the class you need:
* [MineClient](#mineclient) or
* [MineServer](#mineserver)

The super class is called **Minecraft**.

* **request($url, $data, $method = 'get')** sends a curl request to any page and returns the result.
  * **$url** is the requested url
  * **$data** is the data to send
  * **$method** is the method to send the request

MineClient
----------
MineClient is the class to manage client actions

If you want, you can set a custom host:

     $client = new MineClient('myhost.com');

In this case,

* **$client** is the variable assigned to the class
* **'myhost.com'** is the custom host to use (If you don't set it, it will be automatically minecraft's original host)

###Functions
* **login($username, $password, $version = 14)** lets the user to log in
  * **$username** is the username
  * **$password** is the password
  * **$version** is the version
* **keepAlive()** keeps the session
* **joinServer($server_id)** lets the user to join a server
  * **$server_id** is the id of the server to join

###Sample usage
**Login with a Minecraft account**:

    if (isset($_POST['username']) && isset($_POST['password']))
    {
    	require_once('minecraft.php');
    	$auth = new MineClient;
    	if ($auth->login($_POST['username'], $_POST['password'])) echo '<h2>You are logged in as '.$auth->username.'.</h2>';
    	else
    	{
    		header('Refresh: 5');
    		echo 'Wrong username or password!';
    	}
    }
    else echo '<h1>Login with your minecraft account</h1>
    <form method="post"> 
    	<input type="text" name="username" placeHolder="Username/Email">
    	<input type="password" name="password" placeHolder="Password">
    	<input type="submit" value="Login"> 
    </form>';


**Join a Minecraft server**:

     require_once('minecraft.php');
     $user = new MineClient;
     $user->login('testusername', 'testpassword');
     if ($user->joinServer(1081)) echo 'Server with id 1081 joined!;

MineServer
----------
MineServer is the class to manage server actions

To use it, you must declare the server's id and, if you want, you can set a custom host:

     $server = new MineServer(1081, 'myhost.com');

In this case,

* **$server** is the variable assigned to the class
* **1081** is the server's id
* **'myhost.com'** is the custom host to use (If you don't set it, it will be automatically minecraft's original host)

###Functions
* **checkUser($username)** checks if a user is in the server
  * **$username** is the username to check

###Sample usage
**Check if a user is in a server**:

     require_once('minecraft.php');
     $server = new MineServer(1081);
     echo 'testusername is';
     if (!$server->checkUser('testusername')) echo ' not';
     echo ' present in the server with id 1081';
